# 🌿 RTS DESIGN – THE VINE CONFLICT (Expanded Design Draft)

- - -

# 1\. Core Premise

A global-scale RTS set on a future Earth overrun by alien-introduced hyper-growth vines.

The vines are:

*   Not sentient
    
*   Self-propagating planetary biomass
    
*   The main terrain modifier and economic backbone
    
*   A shared system every faction interacts with differently
    

All factions have **infinite income scaling**, but through incompatible relationships with vines.

No faction is morally right — only strategically consistent.

# 2\. Match Flow Structure

## Game Phases

**Early Game (0–8 min)**

*   Scout vine density
    
*   Secure first vine zones
    
*   Light infantry & skirmish vehicles
    
*   First extractors / burners / growth nodes
    

**Mid Game (8–18 min)**

*   Vine territory conflicts
    
*   Mobile harvesters & denial
    
*   Doctrines chosen
    
*   Air units appear
    
*   Neutral structures matter
    

**Late Game (18+ min)**

*   Vine map heavily reshaped
    
*   Superweapons unlock
    
*   Terrain scars influence strategy
    
*   Super units and faction identity peak

# 3\. Resource & Economy Model

Each faction has:

*   Infinite credit flow
    
*   Scaling efficiency multiplier
    
*   Map-control dependent growth
    

## Vine Resource Values

Vine Type | Base Value | Spread Speed | Notes -- | -- | -- | -- Small Cluster | 5/sec | Fast | Mobile harvester viable Large Root Node | 15/sec | Medium | Static extractor target Ancient Core Vine | 30/sec | Slow | Strategic hotspot

# 5\. Combat Stat Model (Standardized)

All units use these baseline stat types:

*   HP
    
*   Armor Type
    
*   DPS
    
*   Range
    
*   Speed
    
*   Supply Cost
    
*   Tech Tier
    
*   Special Ability
    

Damage & armor types follow your system.
