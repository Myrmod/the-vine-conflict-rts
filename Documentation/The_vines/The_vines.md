# The Vines origin

```
Thousands of years ago, before withdrawing, The Amuns seeded Earth with a dormant bio-terraforming organism.
```

Not a plant.
Not a machine.
Something in between.

- The Vines were designed to:

    - Reshape atmosphere gradually.
    - Enrich planetary biomass.
    - Rewrite soil chemistry.
    - Prepare Earth for eventual Amun reclamation.

But they were incomplete.

They required time and an activation signal only The Amuns could trigger through the Anchors.

And then… Humans interfered.

## The Human Mistake

#### Centuries later, in modern times:

Scientists researching pyramid energy anomalies discovered dormant sub-surface bio-structures.
They tried to extract energy.

They overloaded the anchor network.
Instead of controlled activation…
They triggered rapid growth protocols.
The Vines awakened without Amun calibration.

Now they're: Expanding uncontrollably.
Adapting to pollution and radiation.
Mutating fauna and flora.
Developing self-defense responses.
The terraform system is running without its architects.

## The Amuns' Perspective:

#### When The Amuns detect the activation, they don't return out of greed. They return because:

The project is compromised. Earth is evolving outside intended parameters. Humanity tampered with sacred architecture.

From their perspective?
Humans corrupted the design.

Now they must: Reassert control, Recalibrate the Vines, Or purge the planet.

## The Mutated Plant Faction

#### The Vines were never meant to evolve independently.
But rapid activation + human experimentation + environmental chaos caused:

Emergent sentience.
A distributed planetary intelligence.
Not fully conscious like humans.
But aware.
Protective.
Adaptive.

#### Now the Vines don't belong to The Amuns anymore.
They belong to themselves.
So your the plant faction isn't just defending territory.
They're defending their right to exist.

# The Conflict:

### Humans were divided into 2 groups:

#### The pro vines humans:

They believed that the vines are a gift, that humans are evolving, They believed that:

```
The Vines are the next step in human progress, Energy crises ended because of them.
Cities powered by Vine reactors are cleaner and richer.
People augmented with Vine bio-tech live longer.
```

Some even view it as spiritual that the gods has returned through these vines.

```
They think they are saving humanity through the vines.
```

#### The Anti vine group( The resistance):

They saw the vines destroy homes, mutated villages, awaken an evil species, they have seen children mutated.

They believe that the vines are an infection.They saw coropate benefit from the vines, aliens attacking their homeworld.

Their purpose is to destroy these vines.

```
Both sides believe they are saving humanity.
