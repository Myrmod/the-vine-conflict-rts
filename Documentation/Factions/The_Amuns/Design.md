## Origins:
- The Amuns were mistaken for gods by early humanity. In truth, they were architects who were believed to be gods.

- Long before recorded history, they governed Earth in silence. When their work was complete, they constructed pyramids and temples — not monuments, but anchors. These structures stabilized a hidden dimensional corridor, a gateway network only The Amuns could access.

- Finding no further value in a world of primitive humanity and untapped potential, they withdrew.

But they did not abandon Earth.

- They earned their name by being a hidden species that exists in a veil state, a partial dimensional shift always watching and lurking waiting for the moment that the planet would once again serve a purpose.


- Few in number yet unmatched in advancement, The Amuns are an elite civilization of disciplined warriors and masterful technology. Their throneworld lies within Orion — a dominion once mythologized by ancient humans as the realm of the gods.

- Among their commanders was Ra, a war-leader whose presence in the skies became legend. who was believed to be a god of the son with his warship.

The gods did not ascend.

They concealed themselves.
