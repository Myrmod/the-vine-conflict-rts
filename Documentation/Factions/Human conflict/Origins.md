# The Ash war:
## The energy collapse:
- By the late 2020s, the world stood mid transition to renewable energy sources, fossil fuel investment has been slashed but the infrastructue for green resources was not scaled quick enough, oil production declined, rare earth exports were weaponized and global power grid grew increasingly unstable under new demands.
- Energy did not really disappear it became fragile, in 2029 tension escalated around critical maritime chokepoints such as south china sea, a naval confrontation resulted in the destruction of major tanker,triggering panic across global markets. 
- Energy prices surged to global highs balckouts spread across continents Supply chains faltered. Desalination plants shut down. Cities dependent on uninterrupted power began to fracture internally.
- With domestic stability collapsing, several major powers declared energy infrastructure a legitimate military target. Precision strikes hit LNG terminals, nuclear facilities, and strategic grid nodes. In the chaos, a missile strike near an early-warning radar installation was misinterpreted as preparation for a nuclear decapitation strike. 
- A tactical nuclear weapon was deployed in what was described as a “limited de-escalatory response.It was neither limited nor de-escalatory.
- Retaliatory launches followed within minutes. By 2030, the interconnected global grid was shattered. The exchange did not erase humanity — but it dismantled the world order, leaving behind isolated power hubs, irradiated wastelands, and fractured nations built around whatever energy sources survived.

## The energy crisis:
### Following the Ash war(2030-2045)
- Multipe reconstruction attemps, failed green transitions,regional blackouts become permenant ,governments centralizing power.
### By mid century (2045-2065)
- Fossil reserves nearly depeleted, Fusion not scalable, solar power is inefficient due to atmospheric dust changes, atmosphere completely collapsing, Energy became currency.
- Scientist needed to step up to find a logical solution before total blackout.
## The vines discovery( 2069)
- Scientist all over the globe were looking for a reliable energy source, approx 40 years after The Ash war, scientist found in a deep ancient underground prime Egyptian anchor site, They found a dorminant vine like organism.
- This organism was clearly hidden, conflict between scientist arose.
- They began trying to study it, replicate it or applify it to almost no success.
- 1 Scientist discovered that this vine was potientially a completely living organism , tried warning other scientist to not trying simulating it with artificial energy to no success.
- He was shut down by the government , locked up due to the panic he spread about this new organism, governments were desperate for a new energy source, willing to take risk they decided to high simulate the vine organism with energy to stop it from being dorminant.
# The Awakening:
## Across the globe:
- Vine became active instantly, growth erupts in cities and rural regions, Infrastructure swallowed, houses destroyed , farms demolished, millions dead or mutated
- But energy output spikes dramastically.This is where the conflict begins...
## The people divided:
- The humans instantly divdied into 2 groups:
### The elites and government:
- They thought these vines were miracles here to save the planet from the total blackout, Finally a clean source of energy, they thought cities could be revived, economy regrowth.
- They try to supress the early disaster reports bec if vines disappear the planet goes dark again.
### The common folks:
- They saw the horrors happening to them, millions dead mutated , governments trying to supress them,Refugees camps forming, strange mutated forma starting to attack them.
- They say " This is not salvation, this is an invasion a mutation to our lives"
- They quickly side with the locked up scientist , bec they were never consulted, They clearly see that they never mattered.
